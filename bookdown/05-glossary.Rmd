## Epistemic Unceertainty

Epistemic uncertainty is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but does not in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data have been deliberately hidden.

## Maximum Allowable Probability of Failure

A target that limits the probability of failure the product can experience during its assigned mission.  This can range from minimal impact (>10-3), probable (<= 10-3, > 10-5),  remote (<= 10-5, > 10-7), extremely remote (<= 10-7, >10-9), extremely improbable (<= 10-9).
